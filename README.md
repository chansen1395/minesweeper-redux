## Todos

* Create basic UI with empty board - done
* Create a component diagram - done
* Generate random board with bombs and numbers - done
* State: 2d array: Number or a bomb, hidden/revealed boolean 
* Click handler - test if hit/next to a bomb - update board 
* Check win condition

* Redux: 1. w/ hooks? 2. refactor to class? like lessons

## Stretch Ideas
* Vary difficulty/bomb number/board size
